/*#include lets me include cpp libraries like iostream
the "io" stands for "input" and "output" 
iostream is a very standerd libraries and perfect fot this project*/

#include <iostream>
//Now we pick a namespace, standerd works perfect here.
using namespace std;

//main program
int main(){
	//there are a few ways to output data but c-out works with iostream.
	cout<<"Hello, World!"<<endl;
	//endl just tells the compiler to end the line.
return 0;
}
//the main program returns 0 to end, for this program anyway
